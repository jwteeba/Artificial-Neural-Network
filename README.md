# Artificial-Neural-Network
Fictional Scenario: X Bank have noticed a higher turn rate and wanted to address the problem. 
The Bank took a sample of 10K customers and measure everything that they knew about the customers
over a period of six months and observed which customer stay or leave the Bank.

Task: Use artificial neural network to determine which customer have the higher probability 
of leaving the Bank. 

Goal: The goal is to create a Geographic segmentation model to tell the Bank
which one of its customer is at higher risk or leaving.
